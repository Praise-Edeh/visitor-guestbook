Assignment Reflection:
Requirements Met and Goals Achieved:
- Web fundamentals: Additional functionality on the form: Achieved by adding delete and like buttons to each message.
- Web fundamentals: Excellence with styling: Implemented styling using CSS to enhance the appearance of the application and make it visually appealing on different devices.
- Programming logic: Add a delete button to each message and create an API delete route to delete from the server: Implemented a delete button for each message on the frontend and created a corresponding API delete route on the server to delete messages from the database.
- Programming logic: Add a like button to each message and create an API update route to add them to the message: Added a like button for each message on the frontend and implemented an API update route on the server to increment likes for messages in the database.
- Programming logic: Something else that shows a deeper than expected understanding of a full-stack application:** Demonstrated a deeper understanding of full-stack development by integrating frontend and backend functionalities seamlessly, handling user interactions effectively, and optimizing the application's performance.

Goals Not Achieved:
- All specified requirements and goals were successfully implemented.

Challenges Faced:
- One challenge encountered during the development process was ensuring proper synchronization between frontend and backend functionalities, especially when implementing features like deleting and liking messages. This required careful consideration of how data flows between the client and server and how to handle asynchronous operations effectively.
- Another challenge was designing the application's user interface to provide a smooth and intuitive experience for users while maintaining responsiveness across different devices. This involved experimenting with various CSS techniques and layouts to achieve the desired visual presentation and user interaction.

Overall Reflection:
- The project provided a valuable opportunity to apply and reinforce concepts learned in web development, including frontend and backend technologies, database management, and API integration.
- Collaboration with peers and seeking guidance from course instructors and online resources (google, ChatGTP etc.), as well as documentation and tutorials, played a crucial role in overcoming challenges and expanding knowledge and skills.
- Despite the challenges faced, the project was a rewarding learning experience that highlighted the importance of comprehensive planning, attention to detail, and continuous iteration and improvement in software development.
